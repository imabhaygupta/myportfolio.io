        <p>Along with my studies, I also believed in growing as a person. I took part in activities outside the
            classroom, like science fairs, coding challenges, and volunteering. These experiences helped me learn
            important life skills like problem-solving, time management, and teamwork. It wasnâ€™t always easy to balance
            everything, but I learned to stay organized and never give up.</p>

        <p>Now, as a college student, I still follow the same mindset. I see education as more than just a way to earn a
            degreeâ€”itâ€™s a way to grow, think in new ways, and build a better future. I hope to keep learning, improving,
            and using my knowledge to make a positive difference in the world.</p>

        <h3>YouTube Journey</h3>
        <p>During my school years, I decided to try something new and started creating content on YouTube. I worked on
            my channel for about two years, and it turned out to be one of the best learning experiences Iâ€™ve ever had.
            At first, I just wanted to share my thoughts and ideas, but over time, I realized how much I was learning
            along the way.
            <br>
            I taught myself how to record and edit my art videos so people could easily follow along and learn from
            them. Even though I didnâ€™t show my face, I made sure the content was clear and interesting. Over time, I got
            better at figuring out what viewers liked and how to keep them engaged. It really helped me build confidence
            in sharing my art and explaining things through visuals.

        <br>
        <p>Running a YouTube channel also taught me time management and consistency, since I had to plan content
            while keeping up with my schoolwork. It wasn't always easy, but it was very rewarding. I loved the
            creativity it allowed and the feedback I got from viewers.</p>
        <img src="payment.jpg" alt="YouTube Payment Proof" class="payment-image">
        <p>Overall, content creation helped me grow in many ways and gave me real-world skills that I still use today.
            It also showed me how powerful digital platforms can be for sharing ideas and connecting with others.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies & Skills</h3>
        <p>Alongside my studies, I spent time exploring different hobbies that interested me. I was always curious about
            how things worked, especially in the digital world. So, I started learning graphic design, programming, and
            digital marketing. At first, I just explored them out of interest, but over time, I realized how useful and
            exciting these skills were.</p>
        <img src="canva.png" alt="Canva Designing" class="hobby-image">
        <p>Graphic design helped me express my creativity and taught me how to make eye-catching visuals. I enjoyed
            working on logos, posters, and social media designs. Programming challenged me in a different wayâ€”it made me
            think logically and solve problems step by step. I started with small projects and felt proud every time I
            built something that worked. Digital marketing showed me how the online world worksâ€”how to reach people,
            share ideas, and grow an audience.</p>
        <img src="programming.jpg" alt="Programming" class="hobby-image">
        <p>These hobbies not only gave me practical skills but also helped me learn more about myself. I discovered what
            I enjoyed most and where my strengths are. It also made me more confident in trying new things. Exploring
            different fields gave me a broader view of the world and helped me develop a strong and diverse skill set
            that I believe will help me in both my personal and professional life.</p>

        <h3>Online Business Journey</h3>
        <p>In 12th grade, I took a bold step and started my own online business. It was my first real experience in the
            world of entrepreneurship, and I was both excited and nervous. I didnâ€™t have much experience at the
            beginning, but I was eager to learn and ready to work hard.

            I spent time researching, planning, and setting up the business online. From creating a website to marketing
            the products, I handled everything myself. It wasnâ€™t easyâ€”there were many challenges along the wayâ€”but I
            kept learning and improving. Slowly, I started seeing some results. Getting those first few sales felt
            amazing. It showed me that my efforts were working and gave me a huge boost of confidence.</p>
        <img src="business leader.jpg" alt="Business" class="hobby-image">
        <img src="meeting'.jpg" alt="meeting" class="hobby-image">
        <p>
            Running a business taught me more than just how to sell something. I learned how to solve problems, manage
            time, and think creatively. I also understood the importance of customer service and how to adapt when
            things donâ€™t go as planned. It was a valuable experience that gave me a taste of how the real world works.

            Looking back, starting this business in school was one of the best decisions I made. It helped me grow as a
            person and opened my eyes to new possibilities.

        <h3>Pursuing B.Tech</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Engineering, and it has been a very exciting and meaningful journey so
            far. I have always been passionate about technology and curious about how things work. Choosing engineering
            was a natural decision for me because it combines creativity, problem-solving, and innovationâ€”all the things
            I truly enjoy.

            Through my studies, Iâ€™m learning about core concepts like electronics, coding, mechanics, and design. These
            subjects are helping me understand how technology shapes the world around us. I enjoy working on practical
            projects, doing experiments in the lab, and using what I learn in real situations. Every new topic I study
            opens up more ideas and possibilities.

            Along with academic growth, this journey is also helping me improve professionally. Iâ€™m developing important
            skills like teamwork, communication, and critical thinking. Group assignments and presentations have made me
            more confident when working with others and sharing ideas. Iâ€™ve also started connecting with people from
            different backgrounds, which gives me a broader view of the industry.</p>
